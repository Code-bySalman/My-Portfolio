    "content": "I’m a very lazy human - like elite-tier lazy.\n\nMost of my day is spent doom-scrolling through Instagram reels, YouTube shorts, or just staring into the void thinking \"I'll start in 5 minutes.\" I procrastinate like a pro. And every night I sleep with guilt, knowing I wasted another day when I could’ve pushed even a little bit toward my goals.\n\nBut recently, I’ve been trying to face it head-on. I’ve started journaling (on Notion), limiting screen time, and keeping a “micro todo list” - like literally one task at a time. And when I’m coding, I use apps like *Cold Turkey* to block distractions.\n\nAs a web developer trying to build real things and improve my craft, it's hard to stay focused in a world full of dopamine traps. But I’m trying. That’s why this blog exists - to be real, to stay accountable, and maybe to let someone else know they’re not alone in this mess.\n\nLet's get better, one messy day at a time.",

    "content": "<p>If you’ve ever used Redux and felt like you were writing a thesis just to manage a toggle, Zustand might just feel like a breath of fresh air.</p>\n\n<h3>🧠 Real-Life Analogy</h3>\n<p>Imagine you're running a small kitchen. You have a whiteboard where the current state is written:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\"Fridge is open\"</li>\n  <li>\"Oven is on\"</li>\n  <li>\"Dish is ready\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead of shouting updates, any staff member can just <strong>look at the board</strong> (read state) or <strong>write on it</strong> (update state). Zustand is that whiteboard for your React components.</p>\n\n<h3>📦 Why Zustand?</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>No need for reducers, actions, or context setup.</li>\n  <li>Global state with local-feel simplicity.</li>\n  <li>Tiny bundle (~1KB gzipped).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>🧪 Basic Example</h3>\n\n<h4>🗂️ Zustand Store</h4>\n<img src=\"/icons/useCounterStore.png\" alt=\"zustand store\" style=\"max-width:100%; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:1rem;\" />\n\n<h4>💡 Zustand Component Usage</h4>\n<img src=\"/icons/CounterComponent.png\" alt=\"zustand component\" style=\"max-width:100%; border-radius:8px;\" />\n\n<p>No reducers, no prop-drilling, just <strong>straightforward state management</strong>. Zustand is honestly a game-changer for small to medium apps — and even large ones if used wisely.</p>\n\n<p>Let your components breathe again.</p>",
